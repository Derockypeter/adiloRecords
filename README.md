The UI shown below is for a video recording application. People can record their screen, camera, audio using the native Browser APIs.
To simplify the task, no actual backend is required. However, we expect you to mock this backend in order to have a functional app (albeit without any persistence logic). So, you should have a frontend mock of the backend (essentially a list or a map containing the objects to be rendered when the page loads).
To start recording, the user clicks the “Start Recording” button and the modal window shown below is shown. Here the user must select what to record - Screen, Camera, Mic. After this, when they click the “Start Recording” button, they will be required to grant permission to use the selected peripherals. If they have already granted this permission, the browser wouldn’t require them to. This permission process is available in the Browser API, so there’s minimal work for you here.
While awaiting the user’s permission, a blank screen is shown.
